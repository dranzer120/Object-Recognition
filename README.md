# Object-Recognition

This convolutional neural network obtained state-of-the-art performance at object recognition on the CIFAR-10 image dataset in 2015. We will build this model using Keras, a high-level neural network application programming interface (API) that supports both Theano and Tensorflow backends.

In this project, we will:

- Import datasets from Keras
- Use one-hot vectors for categorical labels
- Addlayers to a Keras model
- Load pre-trained weights
- Make predictions using a trained Keras model

The dataset we will be using is the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
